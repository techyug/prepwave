        account and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions
        taken in connection with it. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before you may

        termination of your account. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any
        other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any
        kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any
        part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or
        content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing reasons,
        you may not re-register for our Services. We may block your email address and Internet protocol address to
        prevent further registration.

        <h4>User content</h4>
        We do not own any data, information or material (collectively, “Content”) that you submit in the Mobile

        integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or right to use of all
        submitted Content. We may monitor and review the Content in the Mobile Application submitted or created using
        our Services by you. You grant us permission to access, copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat, display and
        perform the Content of your user account solely as required for the purpose of providing the Services to you.
        Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, we have the right, though not the obligation, to,
        in our own sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any of our
        policies or is in any way harmful or objectionable. You also grant us the license to use, reproduce, adapt,
        modify, publish or distribute the Content created by you or stored in your user account for commercial,
        marketing or any similar purpose.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, on some occasions and in certain circumstances, with absolutely no obligation, we
        may be able to restore some or all of your data that has been deleted as of a certain date and time when we may
